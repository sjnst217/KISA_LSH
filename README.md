# KISA_LSH

## LSH
* Lightweight Secure Hash (LSH) is a cryptographic hash function with a wide-pipe merkle-damgard structure. And LSH is a cryptographic algorithm belonging to the Korea Cryptographic Module Validation Program (KCMVP).  In addition, LSH is easy to implement and achieves high performance through parallel processing instructions such as SSE, AVX2 and NEON. And recently, the research of SPHINCS+ digital signature design based on LSH have been published.
